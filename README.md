Deep Learning Programming Using Python for Prediction of The Highest Prevelance Stunting in East Java

# Introduction
<div align="justify">
Indonesia will experience a demographic bonus in 2030, where the productive age force will dominate the population and become an economic buffer. The demographic bonus that Indonesia will have is the productive age force (15-64 years) which is predicted to reach 68 percent of the total population and the old force (65 years and over) around 9 percent. However, that potential becomes useless if human resources are stunted. According to WHO (2015), stunting is a disorder of growth and development of children due to chronic malnutrition and repeated infections, which is characterized by their length or height being below the standard. Meanwhile, in 2020, WHO said that stunting is short or very short based on length or height according to age that is less than -2 standard deviations on the WHO growth curve that occur due to irreversible conditions due to inadequate nutritional intake and/or repeated or chronic infections that occur in the first 1000 days of life. Based on WHO data, a country is said to experience stunting problems if the number of cases is above 20%. According to the 2022 Indonesian Nutritional Status Survey (SSGI) Pocket Book, the prevalence of stunting in Indonesia decreased to 21.6% from 24.4% in 2021. In East Java province, stunting prevalence has also decreased from 23.5% in 2021 to 19.2% in 2022. However, the Deputy Governor of East Java, Emil Elestianto Dardak, said that he targeted a reduction in stunting prevalence in East Java to 13.5% by 2024. This target is lower than the central government's target of 14% in accordance with the 2020-2024 National Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN).

Based on the background of the problem and previous research that has been described, this study compares prevalence predictions regarding stunting cases using deep learning. This research is very important to be carried out, to produce predictions of the development of the prevalence of stunting cases in the future, which can be used as reference material for the East Java Provincial Health Office to realize the government's mission in reducing the prevalence of stunting cases and find out which methods can be used to make the best predictions with the highest level of accuracy.

# Deep Learning
<div align="justify">
According to https://www.ibm.com/topics/deep-learning 
<br>
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks, called deep neural networks, to simulate the complex decision-making power of the human brain. Some form of deep learning powers most of the artificial intelligence (AI) in our lives today.
<br>
By strict definition, a deep neural network, or DNN, is a neural network with three or more layers. In practice, most DNNs have many more layers. DNNs are trained on large amounts of data to identify and classify phenomena, recognize patterns and relationships, evaluate posssibilities, and make predictions and decisions. While a single-layer neural network can make useful, approximate predictions and decisions, the additional layers in a deep neural network help refine and optimize those outcomes for greater accuracy.
<br>
Deep learning drives many applications and services that improve automation, performing analytical and physical tasks without human intervention. It lies behind everyday products and services—e.g., digital assistants, voice-enabled TV remotes,  credit card fraud detection—as well as still emerging technologies such as self-driving cars and generative AI.
